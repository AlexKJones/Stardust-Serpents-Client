This Application is for the company Stardust Serpents to post and sell products with clients being able to purchase and ask questions about the available products.

Planning Story: My plan was to focus on getting products postable and then to have signed in users be able to post questions on them,  Once completed I wanted to create some advanced functionality to allow users to make actual purchases on the site.

User Stories:
As a unregistered user, I would like to sign up with email and password.
As a registered user, I would like to sign in with email and password.
